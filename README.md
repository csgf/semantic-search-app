# SemanticSearch 

This app allows users to browse the almost 3,200 Open Access Data and Document Repositories integrated in the CHAIN-REDS projectâ€™s Knowledge Base, presented either through geographic maps or tables. Tapping on a marker in a map or on an element in a table, one gets redirected to the corresponding repository in order to search inside it.
The app also allows to use the CHAIN-REDS Semantic Search Engine to search across the more than 30 million resources contained in the Knowledge Base and enriched by means of Semantic Web technologies. For each record found, a short description of the corresponding resource is provided. Tapping on an element of the list, one can access a detailed view with direct links to the document and, if existing, to the related data.
